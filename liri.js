  // inject the user's search term in the queryURL

  // Display name of venue, venue location, and the date of the event 
  // Format the date of the event to be MM/DD/YYYY (look at the moment node package documentation!)

// check if userCommand is "spotify-this-song"
  // Using Spotify Node package info and documentation, make a call to the Spotify API using the user's search term

  // Display to the user:
  // * Artist(s)
  // * The song's name
  // * A preview link of the song from Spotify
  // * The album that the song is from

  // Provide a default searchTerm if the user didn't provide an argument

// check if userCommand is "movie-this"

  // Use Axios to call the OMDB API using the user's search term. Use activities 17 and 18 as a reference!

  // Display to the user:
  // * Title of the movie.
  // * Year the movie came out.
  // * IMDB Rating of the movie.
  // * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
  // * Country where the movie was produced.
  // * Language of the movie.
  // * Plot of the movie.
  // * Actors in the movie.

  // Provide a default search if the user didn't provide an argument.

// check if userCommand is "do-what-it-says" (DO THIS PART OF THE ASSIGNMENT ONLY IF THE OTHER THREE API CALLS WORK WELL!)

  // Use "fs" to read the random.txt file (hint, you will need to require fs! Look at activities 12 and 13)
  // The command will be whatever is before the comma. The search term will be whatever is after the comma.
  // Make the corresponding API call depending on what the command is.

// If the user doesn't provide 1 of the 4 recognizable commands, display message to the user to try again
